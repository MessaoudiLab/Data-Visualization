Select miRNA list

Organism- human

ID- miRBase ID

Tissue- optional, do not have to select

Target type- genes

Input your miRNA IDs, format: hsa-mir-122
*Be careful with how many you put in as it will take longer and be harder to see if you have too many miRNAs and targets

Submit and proceed

Generates a list of validated target genes you can download. Then proceed.

This is where you can set Network parameters or leave in defaults and proceed again.

This is your network image with all targets of your miRNA input.

You can subset this with a DEG list by clicking batch highlight in the bottom right corner.
Input your genes and it will highlight them on the map. 
To only see the highlighted ones, click on Extract current highlighted modules at the bottom of the map menu in the top right corner. 

They also have a pathway enrichment analysis tool at the top right.
